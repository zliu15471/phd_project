# Seismic analysis of low-rise masonry structures with openings
- Focused on seismic analysis of masonry structures with openings; mastered the DEM software 3DEC to develop reliable numerical models by coding; generated artificial earthquake signals using MATLAB.
- Imported built-in functions in 3DEC by judging the ‘true or false’ of the index of every contact and to retrieve the data to compute the force of structures; obtain all the numerical results through data visualization. 
- Applied simple linear regression methods using MATLAB to establish the relationship between structural capacity and opening effects.
